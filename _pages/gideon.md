<h2>Bio</h2>

Gideon Mann is the Head of Data Science at Bloomberg L.P., where he guides the strategic direction for machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and search across the company. He is part of the leadership team for the Office of the CTO. His team works on the company-wide data science platform, natural language question answering, and deep learning text processing, among other products. He is a founding member of both the Data for Good Exchange, an annual conference on data science applications for social good, and the Shift Commission on Work, Workers and Technology.

He has also been active in academic research in fact extraction, weakly-supervised learning, and distributed optimization. Recently, he has also been interested in applications of machine learning to problems in software engineering. From 2007 to 2014, he worked at Google Research in New York City, and his team built core internal machine learning libraries, released the Google Prediction API, and developed coLaboratory, a collaborative iPython application. This followed a short post-doc at UMass-Amherst working on problems in weakly supervised machine learning.

Mann graduated Brown University in 1999 and received a Ph.D. from The Johns Hopkins University in 2006, where his focus was natural language processing with a dissertation on multi-document fact extraction and fusion.
